#DSC Alarm to Fibaro Home Center 2 Gateway

This gateway interfaces Fibaro Home Center 2 to a DSC PowerSeries alarm system using one of the interfaces below. It lets Home Center 2 see the status of the entire alarm system. Triggers can be created for any alarm or zone change, actions can be created to Arm, Disarm, or trip the alarm. 

The gateway also maintains timers to keep track of how long any doors and windows have been opened, as well as how long it's been since it's seen activity in certain areas. These timers can be used to turn off the HVAC system if the wife is airing out the house, or turn off lights in areas of the house that aren't occupied.
